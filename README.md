# Steam using Gamescope guide

A step-by-step guide in setting up Arch Linux to launch Steam using Gamescope in SteamOS mode as an embedded session without a display manager.

## Purpose

The guide aims to provide a simple set of instructions that will enable an experience similar to the Steam Deck but on your computer.

Rather than a 'game mode first' experience with the option to launch the desktop (like the Steam Deck), instead it will allow a choice of logging into a full, flexible desktop with the option to launch directly into game mode.

This is achieved by using a microcompositor called [Gamescope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) to launch Steam in a separate session without a window manager.

### Why do this?

* To enable a console-like experience when using a desktop or mini PC - useful for a living room or entertainment centre set up
* The possibility of lower latency and better frame rates in games for a more responsive experience
* To experience what a Steam Deck is like
* To understand (and appreciate) the excellent work that Valve (and their partners) have put in

## Before we begin

Before we begin the following are assumed:

* A PC with an AMD iGPU or AMD dedicated GPU
* Arch Linux installed
* SDDM and KDE Plasma installed
* Steam installed
* MangoHud installed
* A code editor installed

### Why these requirements?

#### A PC with an AMD iGPU or AMD dedicated GPU?

[Gamescope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) is designed to run on Mesa + AMD or Intel, or other Mesa/DRM drivers with minimal effort. It can also work with the NVIDIA proprietary driver (version 515.43.04+) with the `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` set to the kernel parameter.

But in practice the out-of-the-box experiece isn't as smooth and pleasant experience with Intel or NVIDIA drivers when integrating Gamescope with Steam.

#### Arch Linux installed?

[Gamescope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) is available on the Arch repository and is usually the latest version. Since SteamOS for the Steam Deck is based on Arch Linux it seemed the natural choice.

That said, Gamescope is available in other distributions like Debian or Fedora. Find out more on Gamescope's [README.md](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) file on GitHub for details for the status of Gamescope packages.

#### SDDM and KDE Plasma installed?

* This will make it easier to understand the concept and setting up the configurations and scripts
* Plus, the Steam Deck comes with KDE Plasma - it will be nice in keeping things consistent

#### Steam installed?

* The [steam](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=steam) is the recommended package for Arch Linux
  * `sudo pacman -Syu multilib/steam`
  * For AMD GPUs, make sure to select and install [lib32-vulkan-radeon](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=lib32-vulkan-radeon) when prompted
* This should work with the [steam-native](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=steam-native-runtime) package as well

#### A code editor?

* [Visual Studio Code](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Visual_Studio_Code) is a popular choice
  * `sudo pacman -Syu extra/code`
* The [code](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=code) package is available on Arch Linux

## Step-by-step guide

* Install Gamescope
* Install MangoHud
* Testing Steam launching with Gamescope
* Run through Steam Deck set up
* Testing Steam launching with Gamescope in SteamOS mode and Mangoapp
* Add a script to launch Steam in Gamescope and SteamOS mode
* Setting up a new session in SDDM
* Add a script to switch back to 'desktop mode' (SDDM)

### Instructions

#### 1. Install Gamescope

* Install the gamescope package from the terminal

  > `sudo pacman -Syu gamescope`

#### 2. Install MangoHud

* Install the manguhud and lib32-mangohud packages (available under multilib) from the terminal

  > `sudo pacman -Syu mangohud lib32-mangohud`

#### 3. Testing Steam launch in Gamescope

* To test this, run the following command to launch Steam within a Gamescope instance from the terminal

  > `gamescope -e -- steam -steamdeck`

* Steam will open in a window with a logo appearing and then be presented with a welcome screen.

#### 4. Run through Steam Deck set up

* Run through the set up process by:
  * Selecting the language of your choice
  * Setting the timezome
  * Logging on to your Steam account
* You will then be presented with the home screen (like Big Picture mode).
* Close the window to exit from Steam.

#### 5. Testing Steam launch with Gamescope in SteamOS mode and Mangoapp

* Run the following command from the terminal [^1]

  > `gamescope --mangoapp -e -- steam -steamdeck -steamos3`

* This will run Steam again in a in a window. Navigate to the Steam menu, then Settings, and you should be able to see the bluetooth settings and other available networks.
* Using a controller, open the Quick menu (holding the guide button + A) and select the desired level for the `Performance Overlay`. Run a game and the performance overlay should appear.

[^1]: Be sure to type `--mangoapp` and not `--mangohud`. Also, don't miss the `3` when typing `-steamos3` as it won't work without it.

#### 6. Add a script to launch Steam in Gamescope and SteamOS mode

* Create a `Developer` folder in your `HOME` location using a file manager or from the command line as follows

  > `mkdir ~/Developer`

* Using a code editor, create a new file called `gamescope-session` in the `Developer` folder, add the following lines to the file and then save the file

  > `~/Developer/gamescope-session`
  >
  > ---
  >
  > `#!/bin/bash`
  >
  > `gamescope --mangoapp -e -- steam -steamdeck -steamos3`

* Set the permissions to the file and copy the file to the `/usr/bin/` folder

  > `chmod +x ~/Developer/gamescope-session`
  >
  > `sudo cp ~/Developer/gamescope-session /usr/bin/`

* Test the script by running the command

  > `gamescope-session`

* Steam will open in a window running in in Gamescope and SteamOS mode.
* Close the window.

#### 7. Setting up a new session in SDDM

* (If it does not exist already) create a `Developer` folder in your `HOME` location using a file manager or from the command line as follows

  > `mkdir ~/Developer`

* Using a code editor, create a new file called `steam.desktop` in the `Developer` folder, add the following lines to the file and then save the file

  > `~/Developer/steam.desktop`
  >
  > ---
  >
  > `[Desktop Entry]` \
  > `Encoding=UTF-8` \
  > `Name=Steam (gamescope)` \
  > `Comment=Launch Steam within Gamescope` \
  > `Exec=gamescope-session` \
  > `Type=Application` \
  > `DesktopNames=gamescope`

* From the terminal, copy the `steam.desktop` file into `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/` folder

  > `sudo cp ~/Developer/steam.desktop /usr/share/wayland-sessions/`

* Log off from KDE Plasma. On the login screen (SDDM) select `Steam (gamescope)` from the session selection (located near the bottom left corner of the screen). Use the same login and password as you would log on to the linux desktop.
* This will launch Steam full screen in Gamescope and SteamOS mode.

#### 8. Add a script to switch back to 'desktop mode' (SDDM)

To enable the `Switch to Desktop` invoke Steam to shut down the `steamos-session-select` will be created and placed under the `/usr/bin` folder.

* (If it does not exist already) create a `Developer` folder in your `HOME` location using a file manager or from the command line as follows

  > `mkdir ~/Developer`

* Using a code editor, create a new file named `steamos-session-select` in the `Developer` folder, add the following lines to the file and then save the file

  > `~/Developer/steamos-session-select`
  >
  > ---
  >
  > '#!/bin/bash'
  >
  > steam -shutdown

* From the terminal, set the permissions to `steamos-session-select` and then copy the script into `/usr/bin/` folder

  > `chmod +x ~/Developer/steamos-session-select`
  >
  > `sudo cp ~/Developer/steamos-session-select /usr/bin/`

* Test this by either:
  * Launching Steam using Gamescope in SteamOS mode as a regular desktop from the command prompt

    > `gamescope --mangoapp -e -- steam -steamdeck -steamos3`

  * Launching in an embeeded session by logging off from the desktop (KDE Plasma) and log in again using `Steam (gamescope)` from the session selection
* Using the `Esc` key on the keyboard, or the guide button on your controller (e.g. Xbox button, PS button, Steam button, Stadia button, etc.), select the `Power` option, then select `Switch to Desktop` to return to the SDDM login

### Why these step-by-step instructions?

#### Install Gamescope?

[Gamescope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) is a micro compositor developed by Valve.

It can be run in either:

* an embedded session use case (without a separate window manager), and
* on top of a regular desktop (Gnome, KDE, Cinnamon, etc)

Valve has done some excellent work in allowing Gamescope to integrate with Steam, enabling to launch Steam in an embedded session with ease. This is pretty much the basis of how the Steam Deck launches Steam at boot.

#### Install MangoHud?

MangoHud is the tool used to allow Steam to display the 'Performance Overlay' for monitoring statistics like frames per second (FPS), resource utilisation, temperatures, etc.

The traditional approach was to set an environment variable `MANGOHUD=1` when launching Steam using Gamescope. MangoHud now comes with MangoApp, which is the preferred application to use with Gamescope.

#### Testing Steam launch with Gamescope in SteamOS mode and Mangoapp

It is also possible to use Gamescope with Steam on top of a regular desktop like KDE Plasma, Gnome, Cinnamon, etc. This makes it easier to test this concept by running a simple command from the terminal or command prompt.

  > `gamescope --mangoapp -e -- steam -steamdeck`.

Note: This command also enable MangoApp as well as launching into Steam Deck mode.

#### Run through Steam Deck set up

The welcome screen is usually presented when running Steam in Steam Deck mode for the first time. This is a similar experience found on the Steam Deck.

Without doing this it won't be possible to launch Steam using Gamescope in SteamOS mode as the application will fail on the update process that prevents this set up process to complete.

#### Testing Steam launch in Gamescope and SteamOS mode

It is useful to test if Steam can launch using Gamescope in SteamOS mode as this will enable the following features:

* The ability to connect to a network (without the need of a Network Manager or network configuration)
* Add and remove bluetooth devices within Steam
* Configure performance settings (e.g. mangohud, frame limit, scaling filter, etc)

These features are useful when running Steam using Gamescope in an embedded session to avoid having to set up connections and bluetooth devices separately on a desktop session.

#### Add a script to launch Steam in Gamescope and SteamOS mode

Steam supports a number of flags to tweak and optimise the experience when running Steam using Gamescope in an embedded session. These are often used for the Steam Deck for hardware compatibility (e.g. LCD and OLED screens, HDR, fan control, etc.)

Although this isn't required for the purpose of this concept, it will be useful to prepare a script to launch Steam using Gamescope and make further tweaks in future.

That said, such tweaks can affect compatibility when running games. Keeping things as simple and vanilla as possible seems to be the most compatible way of launching games from Steam.

#### Setting up a new session in SDDM

Adding a session entry to SDDM will allow Steam to launch using Gamescope in SteamOS mode directly without the need of a separate window manager.

Once it is running you can navigate through Steam using the keyboard or a controller. Using the `Esc` key on your keyboard or the guide button on the controller (e.g. Xbox button, PS button, Steam button, Stadia button, etc.) will open the Steam menu.

> **Pro tip**
>
> You can open the Quick menu using the controller by holding the guide button + A.

It is worth noting that if using KDE6 it is assumed that Wayland is used. With KDE5 there is a possibility that X11 is used
by default.

If `Steam (gamescope)` doesn't appear in the session entry on SDDM then copy the `steam.desktop` file into the `/usr/share/xsessions/` folder as well as the `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/`.

#### Add a script to switch back to 'desktop mode' (SDDM)

When running Steam using Gamescope in SteamOS mode, you can send the computer to `Sleep`, `Shutdown` or `Restart` from selecting `Power` from the Steam menu.

However, when selecting `Switch to Desktop` it tries to invoke a script called `steamos-session-select`. Selecting the `Switch to Desktop` option will not work without the `steamos-session-select`script.

In this case, the `steamos-session-select` script will be created to invoke Steam to shut down and (in turn) return to the login screen (SDDM). The `steamos-session-select` is normally expected in the `/usr/bin` folder.

How this can be achieved? Thankfully, there is a simple command to tell Steam to shutdown - `steam -shutdown`. We can test this with the following:

* Launch Steam on your desktop session
* Run the following command from a terminal:

  > `steam -shutdown`

This will close Steam gracefully.
